/**
 * Playtest 2026-04-11 regression — chapter markers must render ABOVE the
 * narration block they belong to.
 *
 * Background: Keith reported that the ◇◇◇ THE CRACKED PIT — SUBLEVEL ONE
 * chapter header was rendering BELOW the narration paragraphs that
 * described arriving in the new location. Visually it read "here's the
 * scene… and by the way we're now at: X" — backwards.
 *
 * Root cause: server emits `Narration` first (the narrator's output is
 * what determines the location shift), then emits `ChapterMarker` once
 * the location change has been detected (sidequest-server/dispatch/mod.rs:1360).
 * The arrival order is Narration → ChapterMarker, but the visual order
 * should be ChapterMarker → Narration. The client's buildSegments() was
 * appending in arrival order with no special handling.
 *
 * Fix (lib/narrativeSegments.ts CHAPTER_MARKER case): when a chapter
 * marker arrives, walk backwards through the segments-so-far to find the
 * start of the most recent narration block (contiguous tail of
 * text/separator/gallery-notice/render-pending/image/portrait-group
 * segments) and INSERT the marker at that boundary. The walk stops at
 * any "structural" segment that delimits the previous turn:
 * player-action, player-aside, system, error, action-reveal,
 * turn-status, or another chapter-marker.
