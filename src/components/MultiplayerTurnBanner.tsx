/**
 * MultiplayerTurnBanner — turn ownership cue above the InputBar.
 *
 * Solves two playtest 2026-04-24 bugs at once:
 *   1. "Multiplayer view has no turn indicator" — neither player's UI
 *      tells them whose turn it is. (Sebastien needs the mechanical
 *      handle; Alex needs to know the wait is normal.)
 *   2. "Considering your words…" hangs read as crashes — without a
 *      heartbeat or "waiting on X" line, the 30-90s narrator turn looks
 *      like a freeze.
 *
 * Renders nothing in single-player (no peers to wait on, no turn to
 * announce). In multiplayer, the banner is driven by ``mpInputState``
 * (derived in App.tsx from canType + per-player TURN_STATUS counts) so
 * the copy matches the simultaneous-action server model:
 *   - 'free' + peer has acted → "<peer> acted — declare your action"
 *     (NOT "It's <peer>'s turn…", which implied alternating turns and
 *     made Alex think she was holding up the group; playtest 2026-04-29).
 *   - 'free' + nobody has acted → "<local> — you have the floor".
 *   - 'waiting-on-peers' → "Waiting on <peer> to act…" — local submitted
 *     but peers haven't yet. Distinguishes from narrator-pending.
 *   - 'waiting-on-narrator' → "Waiting for the narrator…" — every player
 *     submitted, the merged dispatch is running.
