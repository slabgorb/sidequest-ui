/**
 * S2-BUG (playtest 2026-04-26) — wiring lock for ADR-014 / ADR-078 schema.
 *
 * Server emits PARTY_STATUS with `members[].current_hp` / `members[].max_hp`
 * (legacy wire field names — the values are the EdgePool, not HP). App.tsx
 * fans those into CharacterSummary.hp / hp_max, which the CharacterPanel
 * renders as the Edge badge in the header AND as the inline party-row Edge.
 *
 * This wiring test drives that whole pipeline through the React tree so that
 * a regression that re-introduces an "HP" label anywhere in the path is
 * caught at the integration boundary, not just in the component unit tests.
